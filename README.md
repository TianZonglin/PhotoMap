### PhotoMap

This is a simple code to show pictures on a map. To do this, I

- get the geo information from the source images and then store it into a JSON file.
- then, with JavaScript, the geo data is transferred to markers and shown on the map.

Loading data could be a problem when using this program, which should be changed in the future.
